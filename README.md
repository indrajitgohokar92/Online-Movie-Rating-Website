MovieDB website

Created a website called the movieDB.com which lists the latest movies out in the box office and a sneak-peak into the movies which are going to be released soon. Users can also search on the database about a movie of their choice to view information about it such as the Title, Release Date, Average Critics Rating, Age Restriction, Actors in the movie, director and producers of the movie and the various categories the movie comes under and the synopsis of the movie, review of the movie input by other registered users and the average movie rating given by users. 
The user can also signup for more benefits. They can also save movies they would like to watch in their watch list and it can be looked anytime they need it. Registered users can also leave comments, add their individual ratings (what they thought about the movie) for the movies they have watched thereby helping others in choosing the best movie to watch when they go to the cinemas.  
Users can become a member by signing up by after giving necessary information. Each user is identified by a unique username and an email address, thereby restricting duplicate users with same email address.
